# App Engine Migration Plan for Hippo Family Club Application

## Migration Steps

### 1. Prepare App Engine Configuration
- [x] Create `app.yaml` file with appropriate runtime and environment variables
- [x] Configure static file handlers
- [x] Set up entrypoint for the FastAPI application
- [x] Configure instance class and scaling parameters

### 2. Update Application Code
- [ ] Modify `utils.py` to use App Engine's default credentials
- [ ] Create App Engine specific utilities in `appengine_utils.py`
- [ ] Update main application to use App Engine utilities
- [ ] Ensure static file paths are compatible with App Engine

### 3. Test Locally
- [ ] Install Google Cloud SDK components for App Engine
- [ ] Run application with App Engine local development server
- [ ] Verify all endpoints and functionality
- [ ] Test static file serving

### 4. Deploy to App Engine
- [ ] Create App Engine application in GCP project
- [ ] Deploy application using `gcloud app deploy`
- [ ] Verify deployment and functionality
- [ ] Check logs for any errors or warnings

### 5. Post-Deployment Tasks
- [ ] Update documentation with new deployment instructions
- [ ] Clean up unused Cloud Run resources
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts for App Engine application
- [ ] Configure custom domain if needed

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes Required

1. **Update `utils.py`**:
   - Modify `init_gcp_services()` to use App Engine's default credentials
   - Update file paths for static files

2. **Create `appengine_utils.py`**:
   - Add App Engine specific utilities
   - Handle App Engine's environment variables

3. **Update `main.py`**:
   - Import App Engine utilities
   - Update static file paths
   - Ensure compatibility with App Engine's environment

4. **Update `config.py`**:
   - Adjust configuration for App Engine environment
   - Update environment variable handling

### Deployment Process

1. **Create App Engine Application**:
   ```bash
   gcloud app create --project=lucid-inquiry-453823-b0 --region=us-west1
   ```

2. **Deploy Application**:
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project=lucid-inquiry-453823-b0
   ```

3. **View Logs**:
   ```bash
   gcloud app logs tail --project=lucid-inquiry-453823-b0
   ```

4. **Open Application**:
   ```bash
   gcloud app browse --project=lucid-inquiry-453823-b0
   ```

## Expected Outcomes

- Application will be accessible at `https://lucid-inquiry-453823-b0.uw.r.appspot.com`
- Public access will be allowed without IAM policy restrictions
- Static files will be served directly by App Engine
- Application will scale automatically based on traffic
