# Hippo Family Club - Quick Deployment Guide

## Local Demo

We've created a simple local demo version of the Hippo Family Club multilingual audio player that can be viewed directly in your browser without requiring any server deployment.

### How to View the Demo

1. Open the file `local-demo/index.html` in any modern web browser
2. The demo includes mock data for English, Japanese, and French languages
3. You can test the language switching functionality using the arrow buttons
4. The audio player controls are simulated for demonstration purposes

### Features Demonstrated

- Multilingual interface with language switching
- Sentence-by-sentence display with timestamps
- Audio player controls (play/pause, progress bar, speed control)
- Mobile-responsive design with swipe gestures for language switching
- Automatic highlighting of the current sentence during playback

### Next Steps for Production Deployment

For a full production deployment, we recommend:

1. **Google App Engine Standard Environment**
   - Simpler authentication and public access compared to Cloud Run
   - Better support for Python web applications
   - Automatic scaling based on traffic

2. **Required Configuration**
   - Create a service account with appropriate permissions
   - Set up Cloud Storage bucket for audio files
   - Configure environment variables in app.yaml

3. **Deployment Command**
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the App Engine deployment:

1. Check that your service account has the necessary permissions
2. Verify that your app.yaml configuration is correct
3. Ensure your application doesn't exceed App Engine limits (files, size)
4. Consider using a .gcloudignore file to exclude unnecessary files
